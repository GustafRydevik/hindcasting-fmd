## Data

The data used was collected by Bronsvoort etal in Cameroon. Full details can be found in ....

There was the following diagnostic measures used on included cattle:


-Danish C-ELISA
FOr non-structural protein, so will pick up any serotype in theory. 

kinetics from Bronsvoort2004

-South American I-ELISA
Also non-structural and will pick up any serotype

-CHEKIT kit
Final non-structural (least good, "sensitivity" of ~23%)

kinetics from Bronsvoort2004

-EITB - enzyme linked immunoelectrotransfer blot
Non structural, but a binary yes/no response. Americans use EITB and I-ELISA as a combined diagnostic

FMD_VNT are virus neutralisation test, where you do sequential dilutions of the virus and look whether antibodies react or not. 

Higher the number, the greater the dilution with detectable virus levels. 
FMD has seven different serotypes, with different geographical distributions. 
Three VNT tests: A-serotype, O-serotype and SAT2 ("south-african territories") serotype.

PRobang is used to scrape the cells to collect viruses for cultivation. Only done on animals where we think that something is going on.
That's PbP A,o,and Sat2. From herds 32 onwards, we have collected the probang. The numbers are (probably) binary classifiers based on Antigen ELISA-results. 

Finally, FMDS O, A, and SAT2 are the binary classifiers based on the VNT tests. 

# 
# FMD_VNT_A 

# FMD_VNT_O 

# FMD_VNT_SAT2 

If an animal gets exposed, the animal will develop a particular antibody response that will last for years. The VNT results will therefore likely remain for a long time following exposure/infection.  The non-structural ELISA results will disappear within 6-12 months. 
The probang has some sort of exponential decay of viruses/ likelihood of cultivation. So a latent probability of some sort...


An additional thing for the future is that we have recording based on the growth of hoofs and how far up there are records of old lesions.

In terms of animals, we have clinically infected, recently infected, old lesions, and healthy animals.

Monlast is the herdsmans reporting, and can be used as a validation to compare with estimated times since infection. 


One of the practical questions is to go through a herd and try and age lesions. But they did run into problems with sheep flocks that they missed in 2001, since sheep tends to not have clnical signs. Using a stat method would be useful here - something to bring up in a discussion.  In pig farms, at least three infection cycles before the outbreak was detected. Want to try and identify how far back was the herd infected. Being able3 to do this quite quickly would be very useful. 



We can use Alexanderssen2003 as how a VNT response would look like post infection, but obviously conditional on a scaling factor to account for different units. Would go off the contact one.

Names of researchers:

Bergmann (iELISA)
Bronsvoort
Sorensen KJ (cELISA)
Alexandersen
Hamblin
Brocchi
Cuncliffe
Dekker (review!)

People doing long-term experimental infection/post-disease follow up. Possibly Bergmann
Pirbright does short, 1-month studies. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Section 1: using the cameroon data to estimate time since incursion. 


A basic model, just using the cameroon data itself, would likely look something like the following:

monlast~ prior(f(incidence))

P(probang-positive,VNT-Positive)~f(monlast, age,...) ## Could separate, or not...
